    1. Non-required, but logically relevant, characters are randomly chosen, so each Universal Tracker generation
       could create different non-required characters, some of which may not even exist in the multiworld that UT
       is connected to. Similarly, some characters may exist in the multiworld, but not be created during UT's
       generation, so `/next_progression` would miss these items.
    2. In rare cases, due to Universal Tracker integration assuming there are no starting abilities, some
       characters who would normally have all their abilities removed, and become non-progression, could become
       progression when generating with Universal Tracker, and it might not be possible to fit all the progression
       items into the pool if there are more than expected.

    Instead of creating non-required, but logically relevant characters, events are created for each logically
