# Yoda Grab:
# Swapping from some other characters, to Yoda, briefly causes Yoda's collision to appear in front of the character
# before snapping into the correct place. This allows for grabbing minikits, and studs, through some walls. To see this
# in action, keep an eye on the circle that appears above the player's head when they swap characters. For characters
# where Yoda is affected by this glitch, you can see the circle briefly appear in front of the player when swapping to
# Yoda, and then snapping into the correct place.
# Some characters cause a similar glitch with Yoda, but instead of causing the collision to appear in front of Yoda, the
# collision appears at Yoda's last X and Z coordinates, but at the current Y coordinate.
