# todo:
#  - Add more moderate logic for deflecting bolts into silver brick objects with Exploding Blaster Bolts active.
#  - Add more hard logic for deflecting bolts into silver brick objects with Exploding Blaster Bolts active, where the
#  enemies have to be pushed towards the silver bricks because they won't follow.
#  - Add more moderate/hard logic for Flutter characters being able to fly over slippery surfaces (yellow in BrickBench).
#  - Add more hard logic for Grievous wall climbing (https://youtu.be/KkGG4zZmpKk?list=PLVZqKtWzb3Ze1OySnameWsMp29o5t1bx1&t=409)
#  - Yoda Grabs also have some weird interactions with Gonk Droid, where if you swap from Yoda to Gonk droid, move with
#  Gonk Droid, and then switch back to Yoda, the Yoda-Grab occurs at the last X/Z position Yoda was at, but at the
#  current Y height. Maybe there is a use for this somewhere. It seems that if you swap with another character, then
#  this effect is lost.
#  Watto is affected similarly, but Watto allows you to swap from a Jedi character, swap to Watto, and then swap to Yoda
#  to inherit some of the glitchiness.
#  - Add more 'oil glitch' use, getting an enemy Stormtrooper to activate an Imperial panel.
